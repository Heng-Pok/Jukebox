# Jukebox
A desktop app that is modeled after a real jukebox

How to use:
-  Use your own Java IDE
-  Navigate to the controller_view or view_controller and find the java file "JukeboxGUI" (should be found in the src folder/package)
-  Before running it, make sure your IDE has JavaFX set up.
-  Run it
-  You must log in using your account before playing the songs. You can always sign up for one.
-  Each user can play/queue up 100 songs per day.
-  If you quit the app while there are still at least two songs in the queue when you run again, it will ask if you want to continue from where you left off. If you click yes, it will skip to the second song in there and play it instantly. If not, it will start with a clean slate and you have to log in again. When you log out of an account while the queue is not empty, the songs will remain there and should play normally (though this feature is not fully tested yet and will be by later releases).
-  Users can also add their own songs (they have to be mp3 files) to the song library. Do so by adding them to the "songfiles" inside the project folder.
-  There is an experimental feature in there that is not fully tested yet but feel free to try if you wish. It allows you to queue up songs with another user when a previous user is logged out with their song(s) still in the queue.
-  Contact hengsocheatjr@gmail.com if you have any questions.
-  Later releases will be awesome!
